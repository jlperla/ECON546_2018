## GitHub repository
While you can download files separately from this page, you are better off using GitHub.
- Get a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account ID
    - Apply for the [Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) for free stuff (including private repositories)
- Install a Git client.  The easiest is to use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
- Go to the repository you are interested in (e.g. https://github.com/ubcecon/ECON546_2018) and click on the green `Clone or download` button, and choose `Open in Desktop`
- You will then have a copy of this git repository on your computer, wherever you choose to store it.
- Unlike dropbox, GitHub will not automatically modify files on your local computer
    - Instead, you can see if there are changes on the server by opening up your git client (e.g. GitHub Desktop)
    - Select the appropriate repository, and it should `Fetch origin` and tell you if there are any changes.  If you want to update them, you can choose the `Pull` from the server.
